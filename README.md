NetHack iOS
===========

Forked (indirectly) from [NetHack
3.4.3](https://github.com/Vanilla-NetHack/NetHack)

See also the README in the top folder of this distribution for information about
Vanilla NetHack.

This can be seen as common base for various iOS (and maybe even OS X) ports. It
contains some basic files.
